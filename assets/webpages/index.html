            <h1 class="home-title">The Power of Makeup</h1>
            <p class="home-para">It is impossible to deny the power that makeup possesses; our favorite products enable us to create the beauty looks that we love, highlight the qualities that we find most attractive, and capture our own personal definitions of beauty. The most effective cosmetic routines enable modern women to increase their self-assurance and face the world head-on, regardless of what the day may have in store for them.

                When it comes to applying makeup, having the necessary skills may make a world of difference. Applying your preferred products in the appropriate manner and using the appropriate amount of makeup may accomplish two goals for you: first, it can help you get the desired beauty look, and second, it can help you get the most out of your makeup.

                Is radiant, natural-looking skin what you seek? Makeup application is an art; master it with these helpful hints. This detailed guide will teach you everything you need to know about applying makeup, from liquid foundation to gel eyeliner, to get a look you'll love.

                <br>
                Having faith in yourself may be greatly bolstered by the use of the appropriate items. Applying even the most basic basics may make you feel more put together and, in turn, more confident, even if a bold lip color isn't your thing. Makeup can also help hide flaws in your skin that could make you feel less confident.

            <h1 class="home-title">WHAT IS THE CORRECT ORDER OF MAKEUP?</h1>
            <p class="home-para">
                We know you've spent hours watching makeup videos online, studied how your favorite celebs do their makeup, and maybe even tried some of their go-to products out for yourself. But you can never have too many cosmetic tutorials and reference books!
                <br>
                <br>

Before we give you the whole rundown on how to apply makeup, we feel obligated to point out that there is no one, true way to do things.

                <br>

            <h1 class="home-title">WHAT MAKEUP GOES FIRST?</h1>
            <p class="home-para">Applying primer before applying any other makeup is essential if you want your makeup to last all day and still look great. Primers are designed to help your makeup stay as long as possible by smoothing out the skin, filling in small lines and wrinkles, and creating a blank canvas for your other cosmetics to go on top of. Lightweight and oil-free primer is ideal.</p>
